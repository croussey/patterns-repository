 Description




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Domain (if applicable)  |  |
|  Alignment problem addressed  |  A class denoted in one ontology is the union of two classes in the second ontology  |
|  Alignment solution  |  This pattern establishes a correspondence between a pair of classes in the first ontology and a single class in the other. This pattern is agnostic as to whether the correspondence is unidirectional or bidirectional. Direction of the correspondence can be achieved through combination of the pattern with the Class equivalence or Class Subsumption pattern.  |
|  Alignment workflow  |  |
|  Reusable component  |  |

|  Problem example  |  |
|  Solution example  |  Exemple in the alignment language RDF/XML syntax: ```<Cell> <entity1>  <Class>   <or rdf:ParseType="Collection">    <Class rdf:about="O1:PersonBornInCanada"/>    <Class rdf:about="O1:PersonWithCanadianParent"/>   </or>  </Class> </entity1> <entity2>  <Class rdf:about="O2:CanadianCitizenByBirth"/> </entity2> <relation>equivalence</relation></Cell>``` |
|  Consequences  |  A correspondence is established between the two classes  |
