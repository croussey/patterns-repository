 General description

| --- | --- |
|  Name:  |  ComputationalEnvironment  |
|  Submitted by:  | [MichelleCheatham](../User/MichelleCheatham "User:MichelleCheatham")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  |
|  Intent:  |  The pattern is intended to support comparison and reproducibility of computational analyses.  |
|  Domains:  | [Archives](../Community/Archives "Community:Archives")  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       Our goal was to arrive at an ontology design pattern that is capable of answering the following competency questions:      </li> – What environment do I need to put in place in order to replicate the work in Paper X?  – There has been an error found in Script Y. Which analyses need to be re-run?  – Based on recent research in Field Z <li>       what tools and resources should new      </li> students work to become familiar with?  – Are the results from Study A and Study B comparable from a computationalenvironment perspective?  |
|  Solution description:  |  The Computational Environment ontology design pattern models the environment in which a computational analysis was conducted down to the hardware level.  |

|  Consequences:  |  |
|  Scenarios:  |  The tool Wireshark was run on a particular computer in order to analyze network traffic.  |
