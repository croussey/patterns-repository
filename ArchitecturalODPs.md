 Proposed Architectural ODPs




|  | [Problem](../Property/ArchitecturalODPProblem "Property:ArchitecturalODPProblem")  | [Submitted by](../Property/SubmittedBy "Property:SubmittedBy")  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Device-Interface-Link Pattern](../Submissions/Device-Interface-Link_Pattern "Submissions:Device-Interface-Link Pattern")  |  To the author's knowledge, there is limited work to the knowledge description in today's telecommunication networks, let alone the knowledge pattern.  | [Qianru Zhou](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=User:Qianru_Zhou&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Qianru Zhou (not yet written)")  |
| [Quantity Triad Pattern](../Submissions/Quantity_Triad_Pattern "Submissions:Quantity Triad Pattern")  |  Precise and coherent representation of Quantities, Units, Dimensions, and their associate Datatypes confounds all engineering and science domains and applications. Translation between different standards is problematic, performing unit conversions, performing dimensional analysis, and creating/instantiating variables in semantic applications are a few problematic areas such a pattern can help mitigate.  | [JohnHodges](../User/JohnHodges "User:JohnHodges")  |
| [View Inheritance](../Submissions/View_Inheritance "Submissions:View Inheritance")  |  There are ontology domain concepts that are difficult to represent due to the complexities in their definition and the presence of multiple alternative criteria to classify their abstractions.  | [BenedictoRodriguezCastro](../User/BenedictoRodriguezCastro "User:BenedictoRodriguezCastro") [HughGlaser](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=User:HughGlaser&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:HughGlaser (not yet written)")  |
