 General description




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Name:  |  Standard Enforcer Pattern  |
|  Submitted by:  | [MonikaSolanki](../User/MonikaSolanki "User:MonikaSolanki")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  SEP  |
|  Intent:  |  The remit of the SEP content pattern is to represent the relation between standards and the processes, operations, activities and services that enforce them, the domains they cater to and the scope of that specific process, operation, activity, service within the context of the domain.  |
|  Domains:  |  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       1. Which are the standards enforced by this process?      </li><li>       2. Which processes enforce these standardsÂ ?      </li><li>       3. What is/are the domain level scope(s) of the standard?      </li><li>       4. Within the context of the domain what is the scope of the process to which the standard is applicable?      </li><li>       5. What are the prescribed guidelines for a standard?      </li><li>       6. Which prescribed guideline(s) of a standard does a specific process conform to?      </li> |
|  Solution description:  |  SEP provides a mechanism to ontologically declare the conformance of a  process with one or more standards. The pattern is flexible andcompositional. It can be exploited to include few or more guidelinesfrom multiple standards and can be easily combined with otherpatterns.  |
|  Reusable OWL Building Block:  | [http://windermere.aston.ac.uk/~monika/ontologies/Standards-Enforcer-Pattern.owl](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:ClickHandler&link=http://windermere.aston.ac.uk/~monika/ontologies/Standards-Enforcer-Pattern.owl&message=OWL building block&from_page_id=3343&update=)  (861)  |
|  Consequences:  |  The pattern can be applied to use cases in all those domains where a standard is enforced to regulate processes. The main advantage of this pattern is that it provides the capability to link processes, operations, activities and services to their governing standards in a generic and compositional manner. In some scenarios it is possible that a process or an operation does not enforce all prescribed guidelines but enforces atleast some. The pattern accounts for that through the definition of the process enforcing the standard.  |
|  Scenarios:  |  As an exemplifier for SEP, we present a use case from the domain of algal biomass production which depicts the application of SEP to an ontology that models algal biomass production. The Minimum Descriptive Language (MDL) standard proposed by the Algal Biomass Association is enforced by the production operation. MDL recommends a set of descriptive metrics to uniformly characterise the analysis of large scale algal operations. In this use case, the ontology defines the concepts and relationships for the operation and incorporates SEP by enforcing a guideline for measuring Carbon input to the operation.  |

 Additional information



 This ontology models the standards enforcer pattern (SEP). The main advantage of this pattern is that it provides the capability
to link processes operation and activities to their governing
standards in a generic way. The pattern can be applied to all those
use cases where a standard is enforced.
