| --- | --- |
|  Domain (if applicable) | [General](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=General&action=edit&redlink=1 "General (not yet written)") |
|  Alignment problem addressed |  A class denoted in one ontology is the intersection of two classes in the secondontology. |
|  Alignment solution |  This pattern establishes a correpondence between a pair of classes in the first ontology and a single class in the other. This pattern is agnostic as to whether the correspondence is unidirectional or bidirectional. Direction of the correspondence can be achieved through combination of the pattern with the Equivalent Class or Class subsumption patterns. |

|  Problem example |  |
|  Solution example |  Example solution in the ontology alignment language:```<Cell> <entity1>  <Class>   <and rdf:ParseType="Collection">    <Class rdf:about="o1:Human"/>     <Class rdf:about="o1:FemaleAnimal/>   </and>  </Class> </entity1> <entity2>  <Class rdf:about="o2:HumanFemale"/> </entity2> <relation>equivalence</relation></Cell>``` |
|  Consequences |  A correspondence is established between a class in a source ontology and the intersection of a set of classes in a target ontology. |
