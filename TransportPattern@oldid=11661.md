 General description




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Name:  |  transportPattern  |
|  Submitted by:  | [Brandonwhitehead](../User/Brandonwhitehead "User:Brandonwhitehead")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  |
|  Intent:  |  The goal of the pattern is to facilitate modelling the movement of mass or energy from one location to another, based on a common persistent frame of reference.  |
|  Domains:  | [Earth Science or Geoscience](../Community/Earth_Science_or_Geoscience "Community:Earth Science or Geoscience")  , [Geology](../Community/Geology "Community:Geology")  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       What is the extent of a point source pollution event?      </li> Where was a package shipped from and where was it shipped to?  |
|  Solution description:  |  The rive water was polluted from effluent near a large factory.  A package left Auckland, New Zealand, at 5:45am on 01/06/2012 and arrived in Los Angeles, USA, on 01/12/2012.  |

|  Consequences:  |  This CP allows data modellers and ontology creators the ability to filter and categorise large geoscience data stores.  |

 Elements



_The
 __TransportPattern__ 
 Content OP locally defines the following ontology elements:_ 





[![ObjectProperty](public/images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif "ObjectProperty")
__partOf__ 
 (owl:ObjectProperty)
 
[![](public/images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif "ArrowRight.gif")
_[partOf](../Submissions/TransportPattern/partOf "Submissions:TransportPattern/partOf") 
 page_ 



[![ObjectProperty](public/images/thumb/c/c3/ObjectProperty.gif/20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif "ObjectProperty")
__referenceFrame__ 
 (owl:ObjectProperty) This property is significant in that it serves to restrict and disambiguate a myriad of inherent facets, often in juxtaposition, associated with the Earths complex phenomena. The reference frame is provided to restrict the input values for a given instantiation, inherently providing context to the local representation.

 page_ 



[![Class](public/images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif "Class")
__transportEvent__ 
 (owl:Class) A Transport Event describes a specific transport phenomenon, as movement of some mass or energy (measurable entity) from one location to another, based on a common and persistent frame of reference.

[![Class](public/images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif "Class")
__transportEntity__ 
 (owl:Class) The Transport Entity concept represents the identity of the circumscribed portion of energy or mass that is moved.
