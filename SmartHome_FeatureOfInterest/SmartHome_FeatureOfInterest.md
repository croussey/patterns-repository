|  Name:  |  SmartHome\_FeatureOfInterest  |
|  Submitted by:  | [MarjanAlirezaie](../User/MarjanAlirezaie.md "User:MarjanAlirezaie")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  |
|  Intent:  |  To represent the specific feature (property) of a certain object that is observed (measured) by a sensing process. Since an object can have many features, it is not enough to point at the object itself, but one also need to specify the property that is in focus.  |
|  Domains:  |  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       What is the object which is the interest of the observation process? Which property pf this object is important?      </li><li>       Which sensing process (SSN:Sensing) is monitoring the state of the feature of interest (i.e. a specific property of the object)      </li> |
|  Solution description:  |  TBD  |
|  Reusable OWL Building Block:  | [http://ecareathome-ontology.mpi.aass.oru.se/patterns/SmartHome\_FeatureOfInterest.owl](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:ClickHandler&link=http://ecareathome-ontology.mpi.aass.oru.se/patterns/SmartHome_FeatureOfInterest.owl&message=OWL building block&from_page_id=4218&update=)  (496)  |
|  Consequences:  |  |
|  Scenarios:  |  A feature of interest can be "the pressure sensed on the couch" or "the electric-current of the TV".  |
