 Note, that the class Move inherits the property 'took place at' (witnessed): Place. This property should be used to describe the trajectory or a larger area within which a move takes place, whereas the properties moved to (was destination of), moved from (was origin of) describe the start and end points only. Moves may also be documented to consistsOf other moves (via consistsOf (formsPartOf)), in order to describe intermediate stages on a trajectory. In that case, start and end points of the partial moves should match appropriately between each other and with the overall event. {@en}
