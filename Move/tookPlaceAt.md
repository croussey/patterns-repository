 owl:ObjectProperty
 



__Description__ 
 : This property describes the spatial location of an instance of a Move.
 



  





 The related Place should be seen as an approximation of the geographical area within which the phenomena that characterise the move in question occurred. took place at (witnessed) does not convey any meaning other than spatial positioning (generally on the surface of the earth).
