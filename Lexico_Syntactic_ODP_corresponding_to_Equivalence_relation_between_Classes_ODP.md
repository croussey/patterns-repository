 Description




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Name  |  Lexico Syntactic ODPs corresponding to Equivalence relation between Classes ODP  |
|  Language  |  English  |
|  Also known as  |  LSP-EQ-EN  |
|  Intent  |  Recurrent expressions in English that state that there is a relation of equivalence between two classes  |
|  Solution description  |  The set of Lexico-Syntactic ODPs included here have a direct correspondence to the Logical ODP for modelling "Equivalence relation between Classes", described in the Technical report D5.1.1, NeOn project Deliverable (see Web Reference below).  |
|  Description of the correspondence relation between the LSPs and the ODPs  |  one LSP to one ODP  |
|  Related ODP(s)  |  |
