__Description__ 
 : The relation between two topics, e.g. 'star system' (as a Topic) is overlappingTopic with 'Bollywood movies' (as a Topic).
 



 Overlap is typically established with reference to a threshold on the number of concepts or entities that are common between the two topics. Alternatively, it can be established with reference to the a geometrical semantics applied to the spaces (super-topics) of which topics are part (cf. ontopic.owl ontology).
