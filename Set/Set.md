 General description

| --- | --- |
|  Name:  |  Set  |
|  Submitted by:  | [EvaBlomqvist](../User/EvaBlomqvist.md "User:EvaBlomqvist")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  |
|  Intent:  |  To model sets of things (elements). A Set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.  |
|  Domains:  |  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       What is the cardinality (size) of this set?      </li><li>       What are the elements in this set?      </li> |
|  Solution description:  |  A Set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. A Set is expressed by linking to it directly all the members (elements), multiple identical values of members (elements) will be eliminated because by default they are treated as a set.  |

 Elements



_The
 __Set__ 
 Content OP locally defines the following ontology elements:_ 





[![Class](./20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif.md "Class")
__Set__ 
 (owl:Class) Set - A collection that cannot contain duplicate elements.
 
[![](./11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif")
_[Set](./Set.md "Submissions:Set/Set") 
 page_ 



[![DatatypeProperty](./20px-DatatypeProperty.gif)](../Image/DatatypeProperty.gif.md "DatatypeProperty")
__size__ 
 (owl:DatatypeProperty) size - The number of items belonging to a collection

 Additional information



 A Set is a collection that cannot contain duplicate elements. A Set is expressed by linking to it directly all the members (elements), multiple identical values of members (elements) will be eliminated because by default they are treated as a set.
 



 The collections ontology (part of the SWAN ontologies) that this pattern is based on was created by Paolo Ciccarese - Massachusetts General Hospital/Harvard Medical School, and Marco Ocana - Balboa Systems Inc. The original ontologies, and related information, are available under a
