 owl:ObjectProperty
 



__Description__ 
 : The
 [hasPart](../../Submissions/PartOf/hasPart "Submissions:PartOf/hasPart") 
 relation without transitivity, holding between an
 [Object](../../Image/ObjectProperty.gif "Submissions:Componency/Object") 
 (the system) and another (the component), and assuming a Design that structures the system Object. 
The componency Content OP uses the transitive reduction
 [logical pattern](../../Category/LogicalOP "Category:LogicalOP") 
 to preserve transitive on the superproperty from the
 [part of](../../Submissions/PartOf "Submissions:PartOf") 
 Content OP. In practice, the
 [part of](../../Submissions/PartOf "Submissions:PartOf") 
 acts here as the transitive reduction of the
 [componency](../../Submissions/Componency "Submissions:Componency") 
 Content OP.
