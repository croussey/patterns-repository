|  Name:  |  Smart City Strategy Design  |
|  Submitted by:  | [ArouaTaamallah](../User/ArouaTaamallah "User:ArouaTaamallah")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  |
|  Intent:  |  This modular ODP is used for strategies design to transform a city to a smart one.  |
|  Domains:  | [Smart City](../Community/Smart_City "Community:Smart City")  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       How to model a city problems?      </li> How to define a city vision?How to define mission(s) and value(s)?How to identify goals?How to define goals?How to identigy objectives and strategies?How to define objectives?How to formally design strategies for a city transformation?How to design projects for a smart city?  |
|  Solution description:  |  Problem-Cause-Effect ODP is intended to model a city problems and analyse them with their related causes and effects. Problem-solution-vision ODP defines a city vision. Next, missions and values related to the vision are defined using vision-mission-value ODP. Mission-Goal ODP allows to identify goals related to each mission. After identifying goals, objectives and strategies are identified and aligned to goals using Goal-Objective-Strategy ODP. For a formal design of strategies, Strategy ODP is used. Projects that implement each strategy are defined and scheduled using Project ODP.  |
