__Description__ 
 : A location, in a very generic sense: a political geographic entity (Roma, Lesotho), a location determined by the presence of other entities ('the area close to Roma'), pivot events or signs ("the area where the helicopter fell"), complements of other entities ('the area under the table'), as well as physical objects conceptualized as locations as their main identity criterion ('the territory of Italy').
 



 In this generic sense, a Place is an 'approximate', relative location. For an 'absolute', abstract location, cf. the pattern spaceregion.owl.
 



 Formally, a Place is defined by the fact of having something located in it; a Place is located in itself.
