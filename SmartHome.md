|  Name:  |  SmartEnv  |
|  Submitted by:  | [MarjanAlirezaie](../User/MarjanAlirezaie "User:MarjanAlirezaie")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  |
|  Intent:  |  The SmartEnv as a network of 8 ontology patterns relies on the SSN ontology and represents a smart environment. Each pattern model one aspect of such environments including temporal, spatial, objects, network, observation etc. The patterns are: [https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/time.owl](https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/time.owl "https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/time.owl") [https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/geometry.owl](https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/geometry.owl "https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/geometry.owl") [https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/event.owl](https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/event.owl "https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/event.owl") [https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/object.owl](https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/object.owl "https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/object.owl") [https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/sensing.owl](https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/sensing.owl "https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/sensing.owl") [https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/situation.owl](https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/situation.owl "https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/situation.owl") [https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/place.owl](https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/place.owl "https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/place.owl") [https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/network.owl](https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/network.owl "https://w3id.org/smartenvironment/patterns/network.owl")  |
|  Domains:  |  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       CQs can be anything related to the main aspects of a smart environment represented in the form of ontology patterns imported in SmartEnv. The competency questions related to each pattern is given separately.      </li> |
|  Solution description:  |  The solution is based on importing 8 ontology modules and link them together via specializing their concepts.  |
