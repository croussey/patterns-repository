__Description__ 
 : A description represents a conceptualization. It can be thought also as a descriptive
context that defines concepts in order to see a relational context out of a set of data or observations.
For example, a Plan is a description of some actions to be executed by agents in a certain way, with
certain parameters; a diagnosis is a description that provides an interpretation to a set of observed
entities, etc.
