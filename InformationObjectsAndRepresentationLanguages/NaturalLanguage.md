__Description__ 
 : A natural language, evolved and used in a community across time.
 



 Natural languages components are 'temporary' and 'reconstructed' out of actual usage. For example, a grammar for a (part of a) natural language has the status of a theory for that language, but alternative ones can exist (e.g. generative vs. construction grammars).
