 Description




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Motivation  |  |
|  Aim  |  The list pattern just cited provides basic building blocks for a simple tree pattern. However, we opt to change the names of the properties: It seems to be more appropriate to use "hasChild" and "hasDescendant" rather than "directlyPrecedes" and "precedes _, and to use "hasParent" and "hasAncestor"' rather than "directlyFollows" and "follows."_  |
