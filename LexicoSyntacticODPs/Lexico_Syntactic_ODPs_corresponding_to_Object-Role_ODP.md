|  Name |  Lexico Syntactic ODPs corresponding to Object-Role ODP |
|  Language |  English |
|  Also known as |  LSP-OR-EN |
|  Intent |  Recurrent expressions in English to make assertions about objects and the role they play |
|  Solution description |  The set of Lexico-Syntactic ODPs included here have a direct correspondence to the Content ODP for modelling "Object-Role" relations. |
|  Description of the correspondence relation between the LSPs and the ODPs |  one LSP to one ODP |
