__Description__ 
 : A transitive relation expressing parthood between any entities, e.g.
 _the human body has a brain as part_ 
 . When specializing this Content OP, take care of restricting the domain and range appropriately, since it could be counterintuitive to use this relation arbitrarily, e.g. between animals and planets. For an intransitive part-of Content OP, see
 [componency](../../Submissions/Componency "Submissions:Componency") 
 .
