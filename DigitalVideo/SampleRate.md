__Description__ 
 : The audio sample rate is the number of samples of audio carried per second, measured in Hz or kHz (one kHz being 1 000 Hz). For example, 44 100 samples per second can be expressed as either 44 100 Hz, or 44.1 kHz.
The video sample rate of a digital video format determines how often the light intensity of each video line is sampled.
 



 E.g. 96 kHz, 74.25MHz, etc.
