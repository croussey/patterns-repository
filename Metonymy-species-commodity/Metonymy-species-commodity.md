|  Name: |  FAO-metonymy-species-commodity |
|  Submitted by: | [WimPeters](../User/WimPeters.md "User:WimPeters") |
|  Also Known As: |  fish-species-exploited-as-commodity |
|  Intent: |  To establish a link between species exploitation and consumer goods.This pattern has been observed in WordNet, where words share the following metonymic or regular polysemic patterns: animal-food, animal-commodity and life form-consumer goods. This is why the pattern has been named "metonymy".Regular polysemy is a metonymic phenomenon in that it describes the substitution of one word sense by another related sense. It establishes a semantic relation between two concepts that are associated with thesame word. Regular polysemy is regular in that it captures conventionalizedand therefore recurrent processes of sense extension, which have been captured in lexical resources such as dictionaries and thesauri. |
|  Domains: | [Fishery](../Community/Fishery.md "Community:Fishery") |
|  Competency Questions: | <li> For which commodity is the species used when caught?</li> |

|  Consequences: |  the link between species and consumer product will allow the blacklisting of product manufactured from endangered stocks. |
|  Scenarios: |  Yellowfin tuna is provided as fresh or chilled food commodity |
