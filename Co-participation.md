 General description




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Name:  |  Co-participation  |
|  Submitted by:  | [AldoGangemi](../User/AldoGangemi "User:AldoGangemi")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  |
|  Intent:  |  To represent two objects that both participate in a same event.  |
|  Domains:  | [General](../Community/General "Community:General")  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       What objects participate in a same event?      </li><li>       Who is involved with whom in something?      </li> |
|  Solution description:  |  -  |
|  Reusable OWL Building Block:  | [http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/coparticipation.owl](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:ClickHandler&link=http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/coparticipation.owl&message=OWL building block&from_page_id=439&update=)  (748)  |
|  Consequences:  |  Any two objects, agents, etc. participating in a same event, even partly or for some limited time, can be related. The pattern provides room for representing participation in that event as well, by importing the [Submissions:Participation](../Submissions/Participation "Submissions:Participation")  pattern.  This patterns does not allow to express the complete relation between an event and its participants: this has to be added manually.  |
|  Scenarios:  |  Mike and Greta had a great fun together, Aldo Gangemi and Valentina Presutti co-participate at the ISWC 2007 conference.  |
