 Description

| --- | --- |
|  Domain (if applicable)  | [general](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=General&action=edit&redlink=1 "General (not yet written)")  |
|  Alignment problem addressed  |  A class in one ontology is a subclass of a class in a second ontology but there is  no functional description of the exact mapping. There is no way of expressingadditional properties of the subclass.  |
|  Alignment solution  |  This pattern establishes a unidirectional correspondence from a more specific class  in one ontology to a broader class in another ontology. The relation is broadenedto allow class expressions in addition to merely class names.  |
|  Alignment workflow  |  |
|  Reusable component  |  |
