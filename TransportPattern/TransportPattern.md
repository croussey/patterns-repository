| --- | --- |
|  Name: |  transportPattern |
|  Submitted by: | [Brandonwhitehead](../User/Brandonwhitehead.md "User:Brandonwhitehead") |
|  Also Known As: |  |
|  Intent: |  The goal of the pattern is to facilitate modelling the movement of mass or energy from one location to another, based on a common persistent frame of reference. |
|  Domains: | [Earth Science or Geoscience](../Community/Earth_Science_or_Geoscience.md "Community:Earth Science or Geoscience"), [Geology](../Community/Geology.md "Community:Geology") |
|  Competency Questions: | <li> What is the extent of a point source pollution event? </li>Where was a package shipped from and where was it shipped to? |
|  Solution description: |  The rive water was polluted from effluent near a large factory.A package left Auckland, New Zealand, at 5:45am on 01/06/2012 and arrived in Los Angeles, USA, on 01/12/2012. |

|  Consequences: |  This CP allows data modellers and ontology creators the ability to filter and categorise large geoscience data stores. |

#  Elements


_The __TransportPattern__ Content OP locally defines the following ontology elements:_



[![ObjectProperty](./20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __partOf__ (owl:ObjectProperty) 
 [![](./11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[partOf](./GO_Top/partOf.md "Submissions:TransportPattern/partOf") page_
[![ObjectProperty](./20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty") __referenceFrame__ (owl:ObjectProperty) This property is significant in that it serves to restrict and disambiguate a myriad of inherent facets, often in juxtaposition, associated with the Earths complex phenomena. The reference frame is provided to restrict the input values for a given instantiation, inherently providing context to the local representation. 
 [![](./11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[referenceFrame](./TransportPattern/referenceFrame.md "Submissions:TransportPattern/referenceFrame") page_
[![Class](./20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif.md "Class") __transportEvent__ (owl:Class) A Transport Event describes a specific transport phenomenon, as movement of some mass or energy (measurable entity) from one location to another, based on a common and persistent frame of reference. 
 [![](./11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif.md "ArrowRight.gif") _[transportEvent](./TransportPattern/transportEvent.md "Submissions:TransportPattern/transportEvent") page_
[![Class](./20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif.md "Class") __transportEntity__ (owl:Class) The Transport Entity concept represents the identity of the circumscribed portion of energy or mass that is moved.
