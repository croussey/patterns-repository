 General description




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Name:  |  CriterionSetter  |
|  Submitted by:  | [PiotrNowara](../User/PiotrNowara "User:PiotrNowara")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  |
|  Intent:  |  The purpose of this pattern is to provide a broader context for criteria modeling. Possible specializations could introduce new kinds of criteria setters representing criteria in detailed contexts (for example: a pattern for describing the success/failure condition for some actions). Possible criteria setters may include requirements, recommendations, constraints etc.  |
|  Domains:  | [General](../Community/General "Community:General")  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       What defines this criterion?      </li><li>       Are there any criterion setters that determine this thing (or this domain)?      </li><li>       What criterion is defined by given criterion setter?      </li><li>       What domains (and/or domain objects) are affected by a given criterion setter (for example by a requirement)?      </li> |
|  Solution description:  |  This is a specialization of criterion pattern. The criterion setter can be used as an abstract container for requirements, recommendations, constraints etc. The owl file linked below contains a simple example of how this pattern could be implemented for modeling a requirement (see 'Examples').  |
