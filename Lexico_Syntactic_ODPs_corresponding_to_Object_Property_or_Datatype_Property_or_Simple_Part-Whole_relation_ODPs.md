|  Name  |  Lexico Syntactic ODPs corresponding to Object Property "or" Datatype Property "or" Simple Part-Whole relation ODPs  |
|  Language  |  English  |
|  Also known as  |  LSP-OP-DP-PW-EN  |
|  Intent  |  Ambiguous (or polisemic) expressions in English that can state three different types of relations: (1) the relation of possession between two individuals, (2) the relation between an object and its features or attributes, and (3) the relation between a whole and its parts (meronymy relation).  |
|  Solution description  |  The set of Lexico-Syntactic ODPs included here have a correspondence to three ODPs: (1) the Logical ODP for modelling "Object Properties", the Logical ODP for modelling "Datatype Properties", and the Content ODP for modelling "Simple Part-Whole relations", all of them described in the Technical report D5.1.1, NeOn project Deliverable (see Web Reference below).  |
|  Description of the correspondence relation between the LSPs and the ODPs  |  one LSP to the combination of several ODPs  |
|  Related ODP(s)  | [Submissions:PartOf](../Submissions/PartOf "Submissions:PartOf")  |
