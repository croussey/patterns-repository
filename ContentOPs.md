| [AOS AGROVOC Concept Server fundation ontology model](../Submissions/AOS_AGROVOC_Concept_Server_fundation_ontology_model "Submissions:AOS AGROVOC Concept Server fundation ontology model")  |  Act as a basic model for Agricultural Related Ontologies, in particular for the AGROVOC Concept Server. The model clearly identify concepts (domain concepts) from terms (which are represented as instances). Both concepts and terms have specific relationships connecting them.  | [Agriculture](../Community/Agriculture "Community:Agriculture")  | [MargheritaSini](../User/MargheritaSini "User:MargheritaSini")  |
| [ActingFor](../Submissions/ActingFor "Submissions:ActingFor")  |  To represent that some agent is acting in order to forward the action of a social (non-physical) agent.  |  | [AldoGangemi](../User/AldoGangemi "User:AldoGangemi")  |

| [ActivitySpecification](../Submissions/ActivitySpecification "Submissions:ActivitySpecification")  |  This work is concerned with supporting a correct and meaningful representation of activities on the Semantic Web, with the potential to support tasks such as activity recognition and reasoning about causation. This requires an ontology capable of more than simply documenting and annotating individual activity occurrences; definitions of activity specifications are required.  Current representations of activities in OWL do not meet the basic requirements for activity specifications. Detailed definitions of an activity's preconditions and effects are lacking, in particular with respect to a consideration of change over time.  This pattern leverages existing work to fill this void with an ontology design pattern for activity specifications in OWL.  | [Event Processing](../Community/Event_Processing "Community:Event Processing") [General](../Community/General "Community:General")  | [MeganKatsumi](../User/MeganKatsumi "User:MeganKatsumi")  |

| [City Resident Pattern](../Submissions/City_Resident_Pattern "Submissions:City Resident Pattern")  |  This file defines an ontology design pattern for City "Resident.â Why is the development a Resident pattern important for the development of a city data on-tology? In the PolisGnosis project (Fox, 2017), where ontologies have been developed for measuring city performance across the 17 themes defined in ISO37120:2104 (e.g., Education, Public Safety, Health, Water & Sanitation), one of the concepts that recurs across themes is â(city) Residentâ. The provisioning of city services is often contingent upon whether the person is a resident of the city. Whether it is access to swimming lessons provided by Parks and Recreation, or affordable housing provided by Shelters and Housing, many are contingent upon satisfying the residency requirement. This ontology pattern make it possible to define the semantics of residency for a city, and use the definition to automate the classification of a person as a resident or not of a city.  | [Smart City](../Community/Smart_City "Community:Smart City")  | [MarkFox](../User/MarkFox "User:MarkFox")  |

It establishes a semantic relation between two concepts that are associated with thesame word.

An event in this pattern is represented in the form of either a Manifestation or a Complex Event, where a manifestation represents the occurrence of a specific situation of an object which can be directly captured from sensor data ("the TV is switched on"), whereas a complex event is defined based on its preconditions that can involve different events (e.g., "watching TV" happens when "the TV is switched on" and "someone is sitting on the couch").

| [SmartHome TimeInterval](../Submissions/SmartHome_TimeInterval "Submissions:SmartHome TimeInterval")  |  This pattern allows us to represent a temporal distance between two timestamps within an observation process in a SmartHome. There are other situations where we need to measure the interval (temporal distance) in the form of time steps regardless of the exact dates indicating the boundaries of the interval. The latter case is used when we want to define a complex event based on the temporal distance with its preconditions.  |  | [MarjanAlirezaie](../User/MarjanAlirezaie "User:MarjanAlirezaie")  |

To provide this full picture from which to make decisions, we needed a way to resolve the spatial data that tools provide in order to synthesize it together. In addition to missing, incorrect, and inconsistent information, there is also the challenge of not being able to use existing spatial patterns to capture the full granularity or specificity of the geospatial descriptions required to capture full and dynamic geometric contexts.  The Spatial Graph Adapter (SGA) pattern provides us a way to extend the simple identification of geometries and simultaneously assign further descriptions and self-context as well as contextual and relational references to other spatial objects in or surrounding the original entity. For example, not only can we use existing notions say that one surface is adjacent to another, but we have a way to say exactly what type of adjacency and to what extent it is adjacent (more examples in accompanying paper). The SGA has also been implemented for several building industry schemas and our further research is in bringing this and other patterns into full use in a Linked Data Platform (ongoing).  | [Http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Community:Building and Construction](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Special:AddData/Domain Form/Community:Http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Community:Building_and_Construction "Community:Http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Community:Building and Construction (not yet written)")  | [Holly Ferguson](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=User:Holly_Ferguson&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Holly Ferguson (not yet written)")  |
