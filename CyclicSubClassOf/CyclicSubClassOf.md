|  Name  |  CyclicSubClassOf  |
|  Problem  |  Sometimes there are several syntactical forms (e.g. syntactical sugar) with the same logical meaning. Refactoring patterns can transform one form to another, they are independant of a specific domain.  A explicitly defined cyclic SubClassOf chain is more difficult to discover and understand by a human than an EquivalentClassAxiom. Because it is explicitly defined there is not any dange in replacing it with an (explicitly defined) EquivalentClassAxioms.  |

 Ontology




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Description  |  The ontology before applying the pattern contains an explicitly defined cyclic SubClassOf chain with an arbitrary number of classes Ci (i > 0): _SubClassOf(A C1)_  SubClassOf(C1 C2)  SubClassOf(C2 C3)  ...  SubClassOf(Cn A)  |

 Process
