#  Description




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Domain (if applicable) | [General](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=General&action=edit&redlink=1 "General (not yet written)") |
|  Alignment problem addressed |  Two classes have a different intension, and no intersection of their extension.Specifying a disjoint correspondence may help a matcher in not proposing any correspondences between these classes. |
|  Alignment solution |  This pattern establishes correspondence stating that classes are disjoint. |
|  Alignment workflow |  |
|  Reusable component |  |
