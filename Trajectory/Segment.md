__Description__ 
 : The Segment class captures the "connection" between two consecutive fixes. That is, a segment starts from a fix and ends at another fix. If the pattern is used to model the trajectory of some moving object, each segment is traversed by that moving object. Additional information about a segment can be attached as attributes.
