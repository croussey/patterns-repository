__Description__ 
 : Represents the notion of trajectory, this is the main class that can be hooked with other patterns that use the Trajectory pattern. Trajectory in this model is understood as a sequence of fixes connected by segments. There is exactly one starting fix and exactly one ending fix. Each fix has a temporal extent and a place (which is more general than just a location).
