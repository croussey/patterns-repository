 Additional information



 The basic plans execution content ontology design pattern represents the execution of a plan and the entity that participate in such an execution. This CP is the composition of other CPs: situation and region. Furthermore, it expands such CPs with ontology elements that are partial clones of elements from the DOCLE Ultra Lite and the Plans Lite ontologies.
