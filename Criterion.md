 General description




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Name:  |  Criterion  |
|  Submitted by:  | [PiotrNowara](../User/PiotrNowara "User:PiotrNowara")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  |
|  Intent:  |  The purpose of this pattern is to provide a basis for criteria modeling. For more advanced use see the 'criterion setter' pattern that enables describing entities that define criteria (such as requirements, constraints etc.).  |
|  Domains:  | [General](../Community/General "Community:General")  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       What criterion is applied to a given thing?      </li><li>       What satisfies this criterion?      </li><li>       What thing is this criterion applied for?      </li> |
|  Solution description:  |  The criterion is defined as a subclass of description. The owl file linked below contains a simple example of how this pattern could be implemented for modeling a requirement (see 'Examples').  |
|  Reusable OWL Building Block:  | [http://criteria-modeling.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/criterion.owl](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:ClickHandler&link=http://criteria-modeling.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/criterion.owl&message=OWL building block&from_page_id=3032&update=)  (832)  |
