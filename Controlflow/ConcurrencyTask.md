__Description__ 
 : A concurrent task is a task branched to a set of tasks executable concurrently -the sequenced perdurants can overlap-, which means that no deliberation task is performed in order to choose among them. A concurrent task has at least one successor synchronization task, which is aimed at waiting for the execution of all -except the optional ones- tasks direct successor to the concurrent -or any order, see below- one.The axioms cannot be expressed fully in OWL-DL (no value mapping available).
