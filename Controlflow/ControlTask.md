__Description__ 
 : A control task is a task executed during a planning activity, e.g. an activity aimed at (cognitively or via simulation) anticipating other activities. Therefore, control tasks have usually at least one direct successor task (the controlled one), with the exception of ending tasks.The reification of control constructs allows to represent procedural knowledge into the same ontology including controlled action. Besides conceptual transparency and independency from a particular grounding system, a further advantage is enabling the representation of coordination tasks. For example, a manager that coordinates the execution of several related activities can be represented as a role with a responsibility (duty+right) towards some complex task.
