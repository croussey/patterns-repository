 Elements



_The
 __Types of entities__ 
 Content OP locally defines the following ontology elements:_ 






[![Class](images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif "Class")
__Abstract__ 
 (owl:Class) any entity that cannot be located in space-time. E.g. mathematical entities, formal semantics
elements, regions within dimensional spaces, etc.

 page_ 




[![Class](images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif "Class")
__Event__ 
 (owl:Class) any physical, social, or mental process, event, or state. More theoretically, events can be
classified in different ways, possibly based on aspect (e.g. stative, continuous, achievements, etc.), or
on agentivity, typical participants (e.g. human, physical, abstract, food, etc.).

 page_ 




[![Class](images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif "Class")
__Object__ 
 (owl:Class) any physical, social, or mental object, or a substance.
 



[![](images/thumb/8/87/ArrowRight.gif/11px-ArrowRight.gif)](../Image/ArrowRight.gif "ArrowRight.gif")
_[Object](../Submissions/Types_of_entities/Object "Submissions:Types of entities/Object") 
 page_ 




[![Class](images/thumb/2/27/Class.gif/20px-Class.gif)](../Image/Class.gif "Class")
__Quality__ 
 (owl:Class) any aspect of an entity (but not a part of it), which cannot exist without that entity. For
example, the way the surface of a specific physical object looks like is a Quality.

 Example




 That copy of Divina Commedia is a book (Object), the porosity (Quality) of the paper used is 5 mls/min (Abstract). 
The Rock Music Festival (Event) is organized by a friend of mine (Object).
