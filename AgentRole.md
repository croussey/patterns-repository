 General description

| --- | --- |
|  Name:  |  agent role  |
|  Submitted by:  | [ValentinaPresutti](../User/ValentinaPresutti "User:ValentinaPresutti")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  |
|  Intent:  |  To represent agents and the roles they play.  |
|  Domains:  | [Management](../Community/Management "Community:Management")  , [Organization](../Community/Organization "Community:Organization")  , [Scheduling](../Community/Scheduling "Community:Scheduling")  |
|  Competency Questions:  | <li>       which agent does play this role?      </li><li>       what is the role that played by that agent?      </li> |
|  Solution description:  |  stub  |
|  Reusable OWL Building Block:  | [http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/agentrole.owl](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:ClickHandler&link=http://www.ontologydesignpatterns.org/cp/owl/agentrole.owl&message=OWL building block&from_page_id=255&update=)  (1355)  |
|  Consequences:  |  This CP allows designers to make assertions on roles played by agents without involving the agents that play that roles, and vice versa. It does not allow to express temporariness of roles.  |
|  Scenarios:  |  She greeted us all in her various roles of mother, friend, and daughter.  |

 Additional information



 The
 [time indexed person role](../Submissions/Time_indexed_person_role "Submissions:Time indexed person role") 
 CP allows to represent temporariness of roles played by persons. It can be generalized for including objects or, alternatively the
 [n-ary classification](../Submissions/Nary_Participation "Submissions:Nary Participation") 
 CP can be specialized in order to obtain the same expressivity.
 



 The elements of this Content OP are added with the elements of its components and/or the elements of the Content OPs it is a specialization of.
