 Elements



_The
 __DescriptionAndSituation__ 
 Content OP locally defines the following ontology elements:_ 





[![ObjectProperty](./20px-ObjectProperty.gif)](../Image/ObjectProperty.gif.md "ObjectProperty")
__describes__ 
 (owl:ObjectProperty) The relation between a Description and an EntityÂ : a Description gives a unity to a Collection of parts (the components), or constituents, by assigning a Role to each of them in the context of a whole Object (the system).
 
 A same Entity can be given different descriptions, for example, an old cradle can be given a unifying Description based on the original aesthetic design, the functionality it was built for, or a new aesthetic functionality in which it can be used as a flower pot.

__isDescribedBy__ 
 (owl:ObjectProperty) The relation between any Thing and a Description: a Description gives a unity to a Collection of parts (the components), or constituents, by assigning a Role to each of them in the context of a whole Object (the system).
 
 A same Thing can be given different descriptions, for example, an old cradle can be given a unifying Description based on the original aesthetic design, the functionality it was built for, or a new aesthetic functionality in which it can be used as a flower pot.

__isSatisfiedBy__

| --- | --- | --- |
| [Situation classification](../Community/Situation_classification.md "Community:Situation classification")  |  What situations satisfy a certain description? What descriptions can be (partly) satisfied by that situation? What situations (partly) satisfying a certain description can emerge out of this dataset?  |  |




 The Description and Situation content ontology design pattern. This CP represents conceptualizations i.e., descriptions, and corresponding groundings i.e., situations. The pattern is extracted from DOLCE+DnS Ultralite by partial cloning of elements, and is composed of three other CPs: description, situation, and classification.
