 General description

| --- | --- |
|  Name:  |  Roles (OWL 2)  |
|  Submitted by:  | [Rinke Hoekstra](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=User:Rinke_Hoekstra&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Rinke Hoekstra (not yet written)")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  Roles, Functions, Actions and Agents (OWL 2)  |
|  Intent:  |  Capture the relational nature of roles using OWL 2 property chains, using the [Social Reality (OWL 2)](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=Community:Social_Reality_%28OWL_2%29&action=edit&redlink=1 "Community:Social Reality (OWL 2) (not yet written)")  pattern. Using this pattern the role-as-relation and role-as-class approach can coexist peacefully inside a single ontology.  |

|  Competency Questions:  |  |
|  Solution description:  |  Extend the [Social Reality (OWL 2)](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=Community:Social_Reality_%28OWL_2%29&action=edit&redlink=1 "Community:Social Reality (OWL 2) (not yet written)")  pattern with classes for roles, functions, agents and actions. Create a new subproperty "plays" for the counts-as relation. We create new property chains to traverse the context and plays relation, that allow us to infer the role-as-relation from the role-as-class description.  Imports the [Social Reality (OWL 2)](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=Community:Social_Reality_%28OWL_2%29&action=edit&redlink=1 "Community:Social Reality (OWL 2) (not yet written)")  pattern from [[1]](http://purl.org/net/social-reality "http://purl.org/net/social-reality")  .  |
