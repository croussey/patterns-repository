| --- | --- |
|  Domain (if applicable)  | [General](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=General&action=edit&redlink=1 "General (not yet written)")  |
|  Alignment problem addressed  |  A class in one ontology is aligned to a class in the other ontology. However, only those instances for which a value is given to particular attribute are aligned. This pattern is agnostic as to whether the correspondence is unidirectional or bidirectional, direction of the correspondence can be achieved through combination of the pattern with the equivalentClassCorrespondence or subClassCorrespondence  pattern.  |
|  Alignment solution  |  This pattern establishes a mapping between a class/attribute combination in one  ontology and a class in another.  |
|  Alignment workflow  |  |
|  Reusable component  |  |
