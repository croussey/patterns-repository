###   Proposed Re-engineering ODPs

| [CyclicSubClassOf](../CyclicSubClassOf/CyclicSubClassOf.md "Submissions:CyclicSubClassOf") | Sometimes there are several syntactical forms (e.g. syntactical sugar) with the same logical meaning. Refactoring patterns can transform one form to another, they are independant of a specific domain.A explicitly defined cyclic SubClassOf chain is more difficult to discover and understand by a human than an EquivalentClassAxiom. Because it is explicitly defined there is not any dange in replacing it with an (explicitly defined) EquivalentClassAxioms. | [OlafNoppens](../User/OlafNoppens.md "User:OlafNoppens") |
