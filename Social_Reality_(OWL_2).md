|  Name:  |  Social Reality (OWL 2)  |
|  Submitted by:  | [Rinke Hoekstra](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=User:Rinke_Hoekstra&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Rinke Hoekstra (not yet written)")  |
|  Also Known As:  |  Observer Relative and Institutional Facts  |
|  Intent:  |  Capture Searle's theory on observer relative and institutional facts, used in creating social reality. See also the OWL 2 Agent-Role pattern.  |
|  Domains:  |  |
|  Competency Questions:  |  |
|  Solution description:  |  Using the approach taken in [Submissions:N-Ary\_Relation\_Pattern\_(OWL\_2)](../Submissions/N-Ary_Relation_Pattern_(OWL_2)).html "Submissions:N-Ary Relation Pattern (OWL 2)")  we place an observer relative fact (OR) in a context (the observer, C) and the brute fact (BF). For the theory This is a reified relation, and we then specify a role chain that allows us to directly relate the observer (context C) to the brute fact using a relation that reflects the fact that the brute fact counts-as some observer relative fact.
