#  General description




|  |  |
| --- | --- |
|  Name: |  MaterialsProperty |
|  Submitted by: | [CoganShimizu](../User/CoganShimizu.md "User:CoganShimizu") |
|  Also Known As: |  |
|  Intent: |  To capture the provenance an assertion about a material's properties as well as capture the particulars of the property itself. |
|  Domains: | [Materials Science](../Community/Materials_Science.md "Community:Materials Science"), [Manufacturing](../Community/Manufacturing.md "Community:Manufacturing") |
|  Competency Questions: | <li> What is the temperature range where an ultimate tensile strength of x is valid for material y?</li><li> What materials give off a faint odor of burnt hair during a burn test?</li><li> Who established values in the range of x to y as the plane-strain fracture toughness for material z?</li><li> What plate materials have a crack growth rate less than x in air for a stress intensity range greater than y</li><li> a stress ratio of 0.3</li><li> and a crack plane orientation of L-T?</li> |
|  Solution description: |  This pattern provides an extensible and modular content ontology design pattern that captures materials properties, the governing conditions, and the asserting authority. |
|  Reusable OWL Building Block: | [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cogan-shimizu-wsu/MaterialsPropertyOwl/master/matl-prop.owl](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:ClickHandler&link=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cogan-shimizu-wsu/MaterialsPropertyOwl/master/matl-prop.owl&message=OWL building block&from_page_id=4172&update=) (0) |
