 : hasEventObjectBody
 



__Type:__ 
 owl:ObjectProperty
 



__Description__ 
 : Some event processing systems need to distinguish between an event object header and its body, where the event object header is the part of the event object with known content (e.g. known vocabulary) that can be directly processed by the event processing system. This property relates an event object to its body part.
