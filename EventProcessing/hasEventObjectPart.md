__Type:__ 
 owl:TransitiveProperty
 



__Description__ 
 : This transitive property represents a partonomy relation between event objects. An event object can consist of several "partial events" that together make up the complete event object. The parts of the event object do not exist on their own, but exist to "make up" the whole of the encapsulating event, likewise the encapsulating event is not complete without its parts. Please note the difference between this stronger relation, compared to the "hasSubEvent"-property which merely relates event objects to each other, e.g. expressing the triggering of abstractions, but without implying that the events are parts of each other.
