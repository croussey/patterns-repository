 Proposed Re-engineering ODPs




|  | [Intent](../Property/HasIntent "Property:HasIntent")  | [Submitted by](../Property/SubmittedBy "Property:SubmittedBy")  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Classification scheme - adjacency list model - to Taxonomy](../Submissions/Classification_scheme_-_adjacency_list_model_-_to_Taxonomy "Submissions:Classification scheme - adjacency list model - to Taxonomy")  |  Re-engineering a classification scheme which follows the adjacency list model to design a taxonomy.  APPLICABILITY  The semantics of the relation between parent and children items are subClassOf.  There is no multi-inheritance nor cyclic relations.  | [BorisVillazón-Terrazas](../User/BorisVillazón-Terrazas "User:BorisVillazón-Terrazas")  |
| [Classification scheme - path enumeration model - to Taxonomy](../Submissions/Classification_scheme_-_path_enumeration_model_-_to_Taxonomy "Submissions:Classification scheme - path enumeration model - to Taxonomy")  |  Re-engineering a classification scheme which follows the path enumeration model to design a taxonomy.  APPLICABILITY  The semantics of the relation between parent and children items are subClassOf.  There is no multi-inheritance nor cyclic relations.  | [Boris Villazón Terrazas](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=User:Boris_Villaz%C3%B3n_Terrazas&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Boris Villazón Terrazas (not yet written)")  |
| [CyclicSubClassOf](../Submissions/CyclicSubClassOf "Submissions:CyclicSubClassOf")  |  Sometimes there are several syntactical forms (e.g. syntactical sugar) with the same logical meaning. Refactoring patterns can transform one form to another, they are independant of a specific domain.A explicitly defined cyclic SubClassOf chain is more difficult to discover and understand by a human than an EquivalentClassAxiom. Because it is explicitly defined there is not any dange in replacing it with an (explicitly defined) EquivalentClassAxioms.  | [OlafNoppens](../User/OlafNoppens "User:OlafNoppens")  |
| [Faceted Classification Scheme](../Submissions/Faceted_Classification_Scheme "Submissions:Faceted Classification Scheme")  |  Ontological representation of a specific domain concept conceptualized using a Faceted Classification Scheme (FCS).  | [BenedictoRodriguezCastro](../User/BenedictoRodriguezCastro "User:BenedictoRodriguezCastro")  |
| [Pattern for re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the adjacency list data model, into an ontology schema](../Submissions/Pattern_for_re-engineering_a_classification_scheme,_which_follows_the_adjacency_list_data_model,_into_an_ontology_schema "Submissions:Pattern for re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the adjacency list data model, into an ontology schema")  |  Re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the adjacency list model, to design an ontology schema.  | [BorisVillazón-Terrazas](../User/BorisVillazón-Terrazas "User:BorisVillazón-Terrazas")  |
| [Pattern for re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the flattened data model, into an ontology schema](../Submissions/Pattern_for_re-engineering_a_classification_scheme,_which_follows_the_flattened_data_model,_into_an_ontology_schema "Submissions:Pattern for re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the flattened data model, into an ontology schema")  |  Re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the flattened model, to design an ontology schema.  | [BorisVillazón-Terrazas](../User/BorisVillazón-Terrazas "User:BorisVillazón-Terrazas")  |
| [Pattern for re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the path enumeration data model, into an ontology schema](../Submissions/Pattern_for_re-engineering_a_classification_scheme,_which_follows_the_path_enumeration_data_model,_into_an_ontology_schema "Submissions:Pattern for re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the path enumeration data model, into an ontology schema")  |  Re-engineering a classification scheme which follows the path enumeration data model to design an ontology schema  | [BorisVillazón-Terrazas](../User/BorisVillazón-Terrazas "User:BorisVillazón-Terrazas")  |
| [Pattern for re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the snowflake data model, into an ontology schema](../Submissions/Pattern_for_re-engineering_a_classification_scheme,_which_follows_the_snowflake_data_model,_into_an_ontology_schema "Submissions:Pattern for re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the snowflake data model, into an ontology schema")  |  Re-engineering a classification scheme, which follows the snowflake model, to design an ontology schema.  | [BorisVillazón-Terrazas](../User/BorisVillazón-Terrazas "User:BorisVillazón-Terrazas")  |
| [Pattern for re-engineering a term-based thesaurus, which follows the recordbased data model, into an ontology schema](../Submissions/Pattern_for_re-engineering_a_term-based_thesaurus,_which_follows_the_recordbased_data_model,_into_an_ontology_schema "Submissions:Pattern for re-engineering a term-based thesaurus, which follows the recordbased data model, into an ontology schema")  |  Re-engineering a term-based thesaurus which follows the record-based model to design an ontology schema.  | [BorisVillazón-Terrazas](../User/BorisVillazón-Terrazas "User:BorisVillazón-Terrazas")  |
| [Pattern for re-engineering a term-based thesaurus, which follows the relationbased data model, into an ontology schema](../Submissions/Pattern_for_re-engineering_a_term-based_thesaurus,_which_follows_the_relationbased_data_model,_into_an_ontology_schema "Submissions:Pattern for re-engineering a term-based thesaurus, which follows the relationbased data model, into an ontology schema")  |  Re-engineering a term-based thesaurus, which follows the relation-based model, to design an ontology schema.  | [BorisVillazón-Terrazas](../User/BorisVillazón-Terrazas "User:BorisVillazón-Terrazas")  |
| [Term-based – record-based model – thesaurus to lightweight ontology](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Submissions:Term-based_%E2%80%93_record-based_model_%E2%80%93_thesaurus_to_lightweight_ontology "Submissions:Term-based – record-based model – thesaurus to lightweight ontology")  |  Re-engineering a term-based thesaurus which follows the record-based  model to design a lightweight ontology.  APPLICABILITY  The semantics of the relation between narrower and broader terms are subClassOf.  | [Boris Villazón Terrazas](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=User:Boris_Villaz%C3%B3n_Terrazas&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Boris Villazón Terrazas (not yet written)")  |
