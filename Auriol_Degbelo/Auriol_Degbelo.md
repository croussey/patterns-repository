|  Name: |  GeoInsight |
|  Submitted by: | [AuriolDegbelo](../User/AuriolDegbelo.md "User:AuriolDegbelo") |
|  Also Known As: |  |
|  Intent: |  The goal of the pattern is to model the when, what, who, how and scope of insight capture during an interaction session with a geovisualization. |
|  Domains: | [visualization](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Special:AddData/Domain Form/Community:Visualization "Community:Visualization (not yet written)"), [insight sharing](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Special:AddData/Domain Form/Community:Insight_sharing "Community:Insight sharing (not yet written)"), [human-computer interaction](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Special:AddData/Domain Form/Community:Human-computer_interaction "Community:Human-computer interaction (not yet written)") |
|  Competency Questions: | <li> what does a geovisualization say about topic X? </li>At which spatial scale is that statement valid?At which temporal scale is the statement valid? what do other users say about a geovisualization which features share similar traits on a given geovisualization? |
|  Solution description: |  A CONTENTSTATEMENT about the GEOVISUALIZATION with the SOURCE [https://covid19.who.int/](https://covid19.who.int/ "https://covid19.who.int/") is: "the countries most affected (million per population) in the Americas are the United States, Columbia, Peru, Brazil, Bolivia, and Chile". That CONTENTSTATEMENT highlights at DATAPATTERN of type CLUSTER |
|  Reusable OWL Building Block: | [https://aurioldegbelo.github.io/geoi/ns/geoi-20200810.owl](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=Special:ClickHandler&link=https://aurioldegbelo.github.io/geoi/ns/geoi-20200810.owl&message=OWL building block&from_page_id=4642&update=) (0) |
|  Consequences: |  The pattern allows visualization developers to support insight capture during and after an interaction session with a geovisualization |
