__Description__ 
 : A relation of mereological nature that connects a given observation with the activity that originates them: it strengthens the argument that observations are always active processes from a cognitive standpoint, regardless of how conscious they may be.
 



 A standard mereological property from another content pattern may be used in lieu of this one and therefore aligned with it.
