|  Name: |  DetectorFinalState |
|  Submitted by: | [AdilaKrisnadhi](../User/AdilaKrisnadhi.md "User:AdilaKrisnadhi") |
|  Also Known As: |  |
|  Intent: |  This pattern represent schematic model for high-energy physics experiment data. |
|  Domains: | [Physics](../Community/Physics.md "Community:Physics") |
|  Competency Questions: | <li> Retrieve all analyses that veto extra leptons.</li>Retrieve all analyses that used jets in the final state.Retrieve all analyses requireing particles to have an invariant mass near the Z pole.Retrieve all analyses requiring large missing energy. |
|  Solution description: |  This pattern represent schematic model for data obtained from results of high-energy physics experiments, such as ones ran in the CERN's Large Hadron Collider. Specifically, this pattern models the notion of Detector Final State, a composition obatined by a selection of some target characteristics concerning physics measurements and parameters of experiments. |
