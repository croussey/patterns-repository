 Proposed Alignment ODPs




|  | [Alignment problem addressed](../Property/AlignmentODPProblem "Property:AlignmentODPProblem")  | [Submitted by](../Property/SubmittedBy "Property:SubmittedBy")  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [Class Union](../Submissions/Class_Union "Submissions:Class Union")  |  A class denoted in one ontology is the union of two classes in the second ontology  | [FrancoisScharffe](../User/FrancoisScharffe "User:FrancoisScharffe")  |
| [Class by attribute occurence](../Submissions/Class_by_attribute_occurence "Submissions:Class by attribute occurence")  |  A class in one ontology is aligned to a class in the other ontology. However, only those instances for which a value is given to particular attribute are aligned. This pattern is agnostic as to whether the correspondence is unidirectional or bidirectional, direction of the correspondence can be achieved through combination of the pattern with the equivalentClassCorrespondence or subClassCorrespondencepattern.  | [FrancoisScharffe](../User/FrancoisScharffe "User:FrancoisScharffe")  |
| [Class by attribute type](../Submissions/Class_by_attribute_type "Submissions:Class by attribute type")  |  A class in one ontology is aligned to a class in the other ontology. However, only those instances for which an attribute value corresponding to a certain type (subclass of the attribute range) is given are aligned.  | [FrancoisScharffe](../User/FrancoisScharffe "User:FrancoisScharffe")  |
| [Class by attribute value](../Submissions/Class_by_attribute_value "Submissions:Class by attribute value")  |  A class in one ontology is equivalent to the subclass of an ontology in a secondontology of exactly those instances which have a specified property value.  | [FrancoisScharffe](../User/FrancoisScharffe "User:FrancoisScharffe")  |
| [Class by path attribute value](../Submissions/Class_by_path_attribute_value "Submissions:Class by path attribute value")  |  A class in one ontology is aligned to a class in another ontology and the criteriafor membership in the class are specified by an attribute value at the end of a path.  | [FrancoisScharffe](../User/FrancoisScharffe "User:FrancoisScharffe")  |
| [Class correspondence defined by relation domain](../Submissions/Class_correspondence_defined_by_relation_domain "Submissions:Class correspondence defined by relation domain")  |  A class in one ontology is equivalent to the subclass of a class in a second ontology of exactly those instances which are in the domain of a specified relation.  | [FrancoisScharffe](../User/FrancoisScharffe "User:FrancoisScharffe")  |
| [Class equivalence](../Submissions/Class_equivalence "Submissions:Class equivalence")  |  Two classes in two ontologies have the same intension.  | [FrancoisScharffe](../User/FrancoisScharffe "User:FrancoisScharffe")  |
| [Class intersection](../Submissions/Class_intersection "Submissions:Class intersection")  |  A class denoted in one ontology is the intersection of two classes in the secondontology.  | [FrancoisScharffe](../User/FrancoisScharffe "User:FrancoisScharffe")  |
| [Class subsumption](../Submissions/Class_subsumption "Submissions:Class subsumption")  |  A class in one ontology is a subclass of a class in a second ontology but there is  no functional description of the exact mapping. There is no way of expressing  additional properties of the subclass.  | [FrancoisScharffe](../User/FrancoisScharffe "User:FrancoisScharffe")  |
| [Disjoint Classes](../Submissions/Disjoint_Classes "Submissions:Disjoint Classes")  |  Two classes have a different intension, and no intersection of their extension.Specifying a disjoint correspondence may help a matcher in not proposing any correspondences between these classes.  | [FrancoisScharffe](../User/FrancoisScharffe "User:FrancoisScharffe")  |
| [Spatial Graph Adapter Pattern (moved to Content ODPs)](../Submissions/Spatial_Graph_Adapter_Pattern_(moved_to_Content_ODPs)).html "Submissions:Spatial Graph Adapter Pattern (moved to Content ODPs)")  | [Image:USOcore3.pdf](../Image/USOcore3.pdf "Image:USOcore3.pdf")  SGA Pattern: Image: [http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Image:USOcore3.jpg](../Image/USOcore3.jpg "http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/Image:USOcore3.jpg")  Current OWL File Located at: [https://github.com/HollyFerguson/Spatial-Graph-Adapter-Pattern](https://github.com/HollyFerguson/Spatial-Graph-Adapter-Pattern "https://github.com/HollyFerguson/Spatial-Graph-Adapter-Pattern")  To answer the modern, interdisciplinary questions asked within the Building domain, industry tools and data standards need to become far more interoperable in order to be able to provide a full and accurate set of analysis to engineers and designers. To provide this full picture from which to make decisions, we needed a way to resolve the spatial data that tools provide in order to synthesize it together. In addition to missing, incorrect, and inconsistent information, there is also the challenge of not being able to use existing spatial patterns to capture the full granularity or specificity of the geospatial descriptions required to capture full and dynamic geometric contexts.  | [Holly Ferguson](http://ontologydesignpatterns.org/wiki/index.php?title=User:Holly_Ferguson&action=edit&redlink=1 "User:Holly Ferguson (not yet written)")  |
| [Vocabulary Alignment Pattern: Conjoint Instances of an external Class](../Submissions/Vocabulary_Alignment_Pattern/_Conjoint_Instances_of_an_external_Class "Submissions:Vocabulary Alignment Pattern: Conjoint Instances of an external Class")  |  Use of an already defined external concept and instances of this external concept.  | [ThomasRiechert](../User/ThomasRiechert "User:ThomasRiechert")  |
| [Vocabulary Alignment Pattern: Sub property of an external Property](../Submissions/Vocabulary_Alignment_Pattern/_Sub_property_of_an_external_Property "Submissions:Vocabulary Alignment Pattern: Sub property of an external Property")  |  Use of an already defined external concept.  | [ThomasRiechert](../User/ThomasRiechert "User:ThomasRiechert")  |
| [Vocabulary Alignment Pattern: Subclass of an external Class](../Submissions/Vocabulary_Alignment_Pattern/_Subclass_of_an_external_Class "Submissions:Vocabulary Alignment Pattern: Subclass of an external Class")  |  Use of an already defined external concept.  | [ThomasRiechert](../User/ThomasRiechert "User:ThomasRiechert")  |
